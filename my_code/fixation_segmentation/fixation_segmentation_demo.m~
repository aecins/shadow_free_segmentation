% This is a demo of the fixation based foreground background segmentation
% algorithm presented in:
%   A. Ecins, C. Ferm√ºller, and Y.Aloimonos, "Shadow Free Segmentation in
%   Still Images using Local Density Measure", ICCP 2014
%
% The original fixation based segmentation algorithm is by Ajay Misra:

%   segmentation for robotics." Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2009. IROS
