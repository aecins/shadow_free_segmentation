% This is an implementation of the fixation based figure ground
% segmentation algorithm presented in the paper:
%   A. Ecins, C. FermÃ¼ller, and Y.Aloimonos, "Shadow Free Segmentation in
%   Still Images using Local Density Measure", ICCP 2014
%
% The original fixation based segmentation algorithm is by Ajay Misra:
%   Mishra, Ajay, Yiannis Aloimonos, and Cornelia Fermuller. "Active
%   segmentation for robotics." Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2009. IROS 
%   2009. IEEE/RSJ International Conference on. IEEE, 2009.
%
% Input:
%   im,             input image (must be double)
%   edgeGrad,       image probabilistic edge map
%   fix_x,          fixation point x coordinate
%   fix_y,          fixation point y coordinate
%   opt,            options (verbose)
%
% Output:
%   labels,         binary figure ground labels
%   unaryColourFG,  foreground colourmodel probability map
%   unaryColourBG,  background colourmodel probability map
